 The image displays a terminal window running a Python-based AI/ML application for pneumonia classification.
 The command line output shows that the application is hosted on a local server at 127.0.0.1:8889, indicating a web-based interface for testing predictions.
 The system is running in debug mode, allowing real-time updates and error tracking for development and testing.
 The presence of "StatReloader" suggests that the Flask framework is being used, enabling automatic reloading of the application upon code changes.

 The image shows a Google Chrome browser window with multiple open tabs related to a "Respiratory Disorder Detection" system.
 The tabs contain local URLs (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:8000/), indicating that the web application is being hosted and tested on a local server.
 The Google search bar is visible, suggesting that the user is either searching for something or testing the web app.
 The image is labeled "fig:1 command page," which likely refers to a documentation figure explaining the browser interface of the system.

 The image shows a web-based interface for a respiratory disorder detection system, likely part of an AI/ML project.
 The interface allows users to upload an image, such as a chest X-ray, for analysis and diagnosis.
 The system processes the uploaded image and predicts whether the user has a respiratory disorder.
 The background image of lungs reinforces the medical theme, while the hosted web app is running on a local server, as seen in the browser's address bar.

 The image shows the output of an AI/ML-based medical diagnosis system that analyzes chest X-rays to detect respiratory disorders.
 The system has identified that the given X-ray indicates a respiratory disorder with an accuracy of 99.44%.
 The interface suggests consulting a medical professional for further assessment and treatment based on the AI's prediction.
 The presence of a "Test Again" button indicates that the system allows multiple evaluations, likely for different images or improved accuracy.
